# InteractiveSculpture
A sculpture that changes color based on audience voting. 

This was a project for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bautanzt_here/" target="_blank">Bautanzt Here/</a>. Audience members were asked to vote through the web app at certain points during the performance.  The results of the vote would change the color of LEDs in a sculpture on stage, which would dictate what the performers would do next.

This all happened in real-time.  The app was originally hosted on <a href="https://glitch.com/" target="_blank">Glitch.com</a>. Glitch is helpful for hosting full-stack applications although it has limited scalability, so I wouldn't use it for anything outside a small experience like this. We had a maximum of about 50 users at once time on the app.
